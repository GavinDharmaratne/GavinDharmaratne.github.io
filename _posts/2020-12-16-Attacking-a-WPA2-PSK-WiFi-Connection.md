# _Reconnaissance_

For this phase we can identify what type of security the connection uses. We can search where the access point is, so we can conduct the hack close to it to ensure that the connection is strong.


# __Scanning__

I will be using the Airmon-ng and Airodump-ng tools for this phase. The Airmon-ng tool is used to make the Wi-Fi card switch to monitor mode. The command **airmon-ng** is used.
