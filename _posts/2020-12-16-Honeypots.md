###  _The need for honeypots in Information Security_

Honeypots are nowadays becoming an essential component in a network system. More and more people are recognizing the importance of honeypots for their network and deploying them across the network. There are many reasons as to why honeypots are being used for network security, some of them are as follows;

- Honeypots can analyze undiscovered issues that can be detected within the system.
- An attacker’s motive can be thoroughly examined.
- Researches will be able to figure out the probable targets in the system. Once the attacker has carried out their attack, their behavior can be monitored thus allowing researches to work out which sections in the system can be easily exploited. The exploitable sections can then be strengthened to maximize the security level.
- False negatives can be easily captured. This is because once a connection with the honeypot has been established, the connection is treated as unauthorized.
- With the use of honeypots, false positives can be considerably reduced.
- Malicious activity can be easily acquired, with the use of honeypots. Honeypots will be communicated between the attack and the encrypted probes. The obtained activity will then be decrypted by the honeypot at the end point.


### _Classification of Honeypots_

**Low-interaction Honeypots** - Low-interaction honeypots are quite simple to install, maintain and deploy. These honeypots simply emulate different services. The interaction between the attacker and the honeypot’s services is very minimal. Low-interaction honeypots have an easy deployment mechanism and maintainability thus reducing any security risks because of their low interaction level. 

**Medium-interaction Honeypots** - These types of honeypots are more complex than low-interaction honeypots, but less sophisticated to the high-interaction honeypots. Medium-interaction honeypots offer more advanced services; however, they lack a real operating system. Medium-interaction honeypots do not present the attacker with OS access, like that of low-interaction honeypots. However, the probability of medium-interaction honeypots being probed are greater than that of low-interaction honeypots.

**High-interaction Honeypots** - Compared to low and medium interaction honeypots, high-interaction honeypots are highly complex. Actual operating systems are being used for deployment. Voluminous amounts of data are being captured by these honeypots. The attackers can fully interact with the real system, this then allows the entire scope of the attackers’ malicious activity to be logged. The maintainability and deployment of these honeypots are rather time consuming and complex. These types of honeypots use significantly more hardware devices than low and medium interaction honeypots, this then exposes a considerable risk in the infrastructure in the location where the honeypot has been implemented. High-interaction honeypots offer many different types of information to be captured, some of them include;

- The exploits used by the attacker.
- The location of vulnerabilities within a system.
- The tools and techniques used by the attacker.
