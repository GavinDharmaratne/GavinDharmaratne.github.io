# _The need for honeypots in Information Security_

Honeypots are nowadays becoming an essential component in a network system. More and more people are recognizing the importance of honeypots for their network and deploying them across the network. There are many reasons as to why honeypots are being used for network security, some of them are as follows;

- Honeypots can analyze undiscovered issues that can be detected within the system.
- An attackerâ€™s motive can be thoroughly examined.
- Researches will be able to figure out the probable targets in the system. Once the attacker has carried out their attack, their behavior can be monitored thus allowing researches to work out which sections in the system can be easily exploited. The exploitable sections can then be strengthened to maximize the security level.
- False negatives can be easily captured. This is because once a connection with the honeypot has been established, the connection is treated as unauthorized.
- With the use of honeypots, false positives can be considerably reduced.
- Malicious activity can be easily acquired, with the use of honeypots. Honeypots will be communicated between the attack and the encrypted probes. The obtained activity will then be decrypted by the honeypot at the end point.
