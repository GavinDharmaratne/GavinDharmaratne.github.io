I am Gavin Dharmaratne, graduated in BEng (Hons) in Computer Networks & Security from Staffordshire University UK. I have a CCNA qualification, and I am working towards obtaining a CEH certification. I take a leadership role, analyze the problem and organize the implementation of the relevant solutions. Even so, I remain open to learning new strategies when needed.
